MENA Horizon 2030: Navigating Risk and Opportunity in

a Transforming Economic Landscape

Section I: Executive Summary & Strategic Outlook

The MENA Economy at a Glance

The economic trajectory of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region over the past decade has been a narrative of profound

shocks, tested resilience, and the genesis of ambitious transformation. From 2015 to 2025, the region navigated a series of

disruptive global and internal events, including the 2015 oil price collapse, the wides prea d economic paralysis of the COVID -19

pandemic, and the persistent, growth -sapping effects of geopolitical conflicts. This period of volatility exposed deep -seated

structural vulnerabilities but also acted as a powerful catalyst for reform, particularly within the hydrocarbon -exporting nations

of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Looking ahead to the 2026 -2030 forecast period, the MENA region enters a critical phase that can be characterized as a race

against time. The imperative to diversify economies , create sustainable employment for a burgeoning youth population, and build

resilience to climate change is more urgent than ever. The success of this transition will depend on the ability of regional

governments to sustain the momentum of economic reform s wh ile navigating a landscape fraught with challenges, including the

ever -present risk of conflict, the pressures of demographic change, and the uncertainties of a fragmenting global economic order.2

The outlook is one of cautious optimism, with a project ed a cceleration in growth, yet this is heavily contingent on a complex

interplay of oil market dynamics, private sector vitality, and regional stability.

Core Strategic Insights for Decision -Makers

For investors, business owners, and senior managers, navig ating the MENA region requires a nuanced understanding of its

underlying dynamics. The following strategic insights distill the most critical findings of this report:

• A Two -Speed Economy is the Defining Feature: The MENA region does not possess a monolithi c economy. A stark and

widening divergence exists between the capital -rich, reform -driven GCC states and the more structurally challenged,

often debt -laden, oil -importing nations. The GCC is poised for stronger growth, fueled by both a recovery in the oil

sector and robust expansion in non -oil activities. In contrast, many oil -importing economies face a more arduous path,

grappling with high inflation, fiscal constraints, and the immediate spillovers from regional instability. Investment and

market -entry st rategies must be calibrated to these two distinct risk -and-reward profiles.

• The Private Sector is the Primary Bottleneck and Opportunity: A consistent theme across analyses from the World

Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the identification of an underperforming private sector as the

principal impediment to sustainable, long -term regional growth . This presents a dual reality: it is a significant risk for

those anticipating rapid, organic market expansion, but it also represents a substantial opportunity for investors and

companies that can align with government initiatives aimed at improving the business environment, fostering

competition, and stimulating private enterprise .

• Geopolitical Risk is an Active Variable, Not a Background Condition: In the MENA region, geopolitical events are not

merely a background consideration but a primary variable that actively shapes economic forecasts. Ongoing conflicts,

shipping disruptions in vital trade arteries like the Red Sea, and the potential for wider instability directly impact

inflation, trade volumes, tourism flows, and investor sentiment. A robust risk mitigation framework is therefore not a

secondary concern but a central pillar of any successful regional strategy.

• The Green Transition and Digital Transformation are Intertwined Imperatives: The region's future economic

competitiveness will be fundamentally defined by its success in leveraging digital transformation —including artificial

intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and advanced data infrastru cture—to enable a green transition toward renewable

energy and water security. The nexus of these two megatrends represents the most significant long -term growth

opportunity, creating new markets and value chains independent of traditional hydrocarbon weal th.

Section II: The Decade in Review (2015 -2025): A Foundation of Volatility

and Transition

Macroeconomic Trajectory Analysis

The economic performance of the MENA region between 2015 and 2025 was defi ned by a sequence of external shocks and

internal pressures that resulted in a period of chronic low growth, punctuated by brief, volatile swings. The decade began in the

shadow of the Arab Spring, with many economies still grappling with its politi cal and economic aftershocks. This fragile state was

immediately tested by the sharp decline in global oil prices in 2015, which severely strained the fiscal balances of both oil -

exporting and oil -importing nations, the latter being heavily reliant on aid and rem ittances from the former.

Following this shock, the region entered a phase of modest and highly uneven recovery. This fragile momentum was decisively

broken by the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020, which triggered a severe contraction in output across all economi es due to lockdowns,

disrupted supply chains, and the collapse of key sectors like tourism . The post -pandemic rebound was sharp, particularly for the

GCC countries, which benefited from a significant commodity price windfall in 2022, leading to the region' s fastest growth rate

since 2016.

However, this recovery proved short -lived. The period from 2023 to 2025 has been marked by a return to the sluggish growth that

characterized the pre -pandemic decade. This slowdown has been driven by a confluence o f factor s: voluntary oil production cuts

by OPEC+ members to support prices, persistent global economic headwinds, the tightening of global financial conditions, risi ng

public debt, and, critically, the escalating impact of regional conflicts. Economic gro wth acro ss the MENA region was estimated at

a modest 1.9% to 2.0% in 2023, with forecasts for 2024 pointing to a similarly subdued rate of 1.9% to 2.2%. A moderate

acceleration to 2.6% is anticipated for 2025, contingent on an easing of oil production cuts and a m oderation of inflation in

importing countries.

Table 1: MENA Region - Key Macroeconomic Indicators (2015 -2025)

Deep Dive into Persistent Headwinds

The macroeconomic data reveals a decade of struggle, shaped by four interconnected and persistent challenges that continue to

define the region's economic landsca pe.

Geopolitical Instability and the Cost of Conflict

Conflict is the single most destructive economic force in the MENA region. Its impact extends far beyond the immediate

humanitarian toll, creating long -term economic scarring that erases decades of deve lopment progress. Analysis by the World Bank

presents a stark quantification of this damage: in conflict -affected MENA countries, GDP per capita could have been up to 45%

higher over the past 30 years in a hypothetical s cenario without conflict. This loss is equivalent to forfeiting 35 years of economic

development, a staggering opportunity cost that perpetuates cycles of poverty and fragility.

The past decade has seen this dynamic play out with devastating consequences. The ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Su dan, for

example, have not only caused near -total economic collapse within their borders —with Gaza's GDP contracting by 86% in the

fourth quarter of 2023 —but have also generated significant negative spillovers across the region. These spillovers manifest a s

heightened uncertainty that deters investment, disruptions to vital trade routes like the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, and a s evere

impact on tourism in neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. For business and i nvestment, this transforms geopoliti cal

risk from a remote, tail -risk event into an immediate, operational reality that must be actively managed.

Structural Economic Weaknesses and the Private Sector Deficit

Beneath the volatility of commodity prices and the tragedy of conflict lies a d eeper, more chronic challenge: the structural

weakness of the region's economies. The central issue, identified consistently by international financial institutions, is th e

underperformance of the private sector. Across much of MENA, the private sector is not the dynamic engine of growth and job

creation it needs to be. It is characterized by a lack of dynamism, with few firms investing in physical capital, workforce

development, or innovation. Market entry and exit remai n difficult, stifling competition an d protecting incumbent, often

inefficient, firms.

This creates a dualistic economic structure: a small, often well -connected formal sector coexists with a vast, low -productivity

informal sector where the majority of the population finds precarious employme nt. This fundamental weakness is the root cause

of the region's historically sluggish growth and its vulnerability to shocks. Without a thriving private sector to create job s, boost

livelihoods, and serve as a bastion of innovation, economies remain overly dependent on state expenditure, which is itself

vulnerable to the boom -and-bust cycles of hydrocarbon revenues.

The Growing Burden of Public Debt

Over the past decade, and accelerating during the pandemic, public debt -to-GDP ratios have increased signific antly across many

MENA economies, particularly among oil importers. This rising indebtedness creates a formidable barrier to growth. For these

countries, fiscal space is increasingly tight, limiting their ability to make crucial public investments in educa tion, health, and

climate -resilient infrastructure.

The World Bank has identified a pernicious cycle specific to the region's oil importers: periods of economic growth often coi ncide

with even faster accumulation of publ ic debt. This means that, unlike in other emerging markets, growth does not lead to a

reduction in the relative debt burden. These economies find it exceptionally difficult to "grow out of debt," trapping them i n a

low-growth, high -debt equilibrium that re quires difficult fiscal consolidatio n measures, further dampening economic activity. This

dynamic underscores the fragility of oil -importing economies and their dependence on external financing and aid.

Labor Market Disparities: The Youth and Gender Gaps

The MENA region's most valuable and u nderutilized asset is its human capital. The labor market is marked by two profound and

persistent failures. First, youth unemployment is among the highest in the world, with forecasts predicting it will remain ab ove a

staggering 24%. With a rapidly expand ing working -age population, the failure to create sufficient jobs for young people is not only

a waste of economic potential but also a significant driver of social and political unrest.

Second, female labor force partic ipation rates are the lowest globall y. This is a critical economic issue. The exclusion of a highly

educated and talented female population from the workforce represents a massive misallocation of resources. The economic

gains from addressing this gap are potentially transformative. Accordin g to World Bank estimates, simply closing the gender

employment gap could increase per capita income by approximately 50% in a typical MENA economy. This highlights a powerful,

yet largely untapped, lever for acceleratin g growth and prosperity.

The economi c story of the last decade is thus one of divergence. For many non -GCC nations, beset by conflict and structural

impediments, it has been a "lost decade" for development. For the GCC, however, this same period, while cha llenging, served as

the crucible in which ambitious, large -scale reform programs like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 were forged. It was not a lost decade,

but a "decade of groundwork" for a post -oil future, setting the stage for the profound economic bifurcati on that now defines the

region. Thi s period also brought into sharp relief the dangerous interplay of the region's deepest challenges. Rapid population

growth, which is projected to see the MENA population double that of Europe by 2100, is placing immense pressure on the world's

most water -scarce region —a problem acutely exacerbated by climate change. This nexus threatens food security, drives

unsustainable urbanization, and acts as a potent catalyst for social instability, creating a feedback loop of frag ility that will be a

defining challe nge for the decade to come.

Section III: MENA Economic Forecast (2026 -2030):

Charting a Path Through Uncertainty

Regional Growth Projections

The economic outlook for the MENA region in the latter half of the 2020s points towards a period of strengtheni ng growth, though

the trajectory remains subject to significant uncertainty and persistent downside risks. Following a modest performance in 20 24-

2025, regional GDP growth is projected to accelerate, reaching an average of 3.7% to 4.1% in the 2026 -2027 per iod. This

represents a notable improvement over the sluggish rates that have characterized much of the past decade.

However, this forecast must be tempered with caution. The IMF, in its medium -term outlook, repea tedly warns that growth is

likely to remain subdued and close to its low historical average, reflecting the deep -seated structural challenges that have yet to

be fully resolved. The entire forecast is shrouded in what is described as "high" and "resurgent" uncertainty, with the balance of

risks tilt ed firmly to the downside. Navigating this environment will require exceptional policy discipline and resilience from both

governments and the private sector.

Drivers of Future Growth

The anticipated acceleration in regional growth is predicated on three p rimary drivers, each with its own set of dependencies and

vulnerabilities:

• The Rebound of the Oil Sector: The most significant factor underpinning the stronger growth forecasts for 2026 and

beyond is the assumed gradual expansion of oil activity. This is l inked directly to the planned rollback of voluntary

production cuts by OPEC+ member countries. This driver, while powerful in the short term, highlights the region's

continued reliance on the hydrocarbon sector t o fuel its broader economic ambitions. The p ace of this rebound will be

contingent on the health of the global economy and the trajectory of global oil demand.

• Sustained Non -Oil Sector Momentum: Within the GCC, the non -oil economy has become a resilient an d independent

engine of growth. Fueled by ma ssive public and private investment linked to national diversification strategies, sectors

such as tourism, logistics, technology, and construction are expected to sustain robust expansion, averaging around 4%

annually. This momentum is a direct result of the reform efforts undertaken in the previous decade and is crucial for

long -term economic sustainability.

• Recovery in Oil -Importing Economies: For the region's oil importers, the growth outlook is tied to improv ements in

domestic conditions. A projected m oderation of inflation from the extreme peaks seen in recent years is expected to

ease pressure on households and support a recovery in private consumption. This, combined with a potential rebound

in key sectors like agriculture (assuming favorable weather conditions) and tourism (assuming regional stability), will be

the main drivers of their modest recovery.

Navigating Future Risks

The path to 2030 is laden with significant risks that could derail the baseline forecast. Stakeholders must prepare for a r ange of

potential disruptions:

• Geopolitical Escalation: The primary and most immediate threat remains the escalation or widening of existing regional

conflicts. A broader conflict would have severe and im mediate economic consequences, disrupting energy mar kets,

halting tourism, shattering investor confidence, and diverting critical fiscal resources toward security expenditure.

• Geoeconomic Fragmentation and Trade Tensions: As highly open economies integrate d into global supply chains,

MENA nations are partic ularly vulnerable to the trend of geoeconomic fragmentation. Rising global trade tensions,

policy uncertainty in major economies, and the potential for increased protectionism could weaken external demand

for the region's goods and services, disrupting a k ey pillar of growth.

• Climate and Environmental Shocks: Climate change is no longer a distant threat but a present and escalating economic

risk. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, pose a direct threat to sectors like agriculture and touris m.

Worsening water scarcity and land degradation are long -term structural challenges that threaten food security and could

displace populations, adding to social and economic pressures.

The forecast perio d reveals a critical paradox for the region's oil ex porters. The very diversification efforts aimed at reducing long -

term dependence on hydrocarbons are being funded by the revenues generated from a short -term rebound in oil production.

This creates a fund amental vulnerability: a premature or sharper -than -expected decline in global oil prices or demand could starve

these transformative national projects of the capital they need to succeed. This potential "funding cliff" represents a core strategic

risk, as the success of the long -term goal of diversification remains highly sensitive to the short -term performance of the very

sector from which they are trying to transition.

Comparative Economic Outlook: GCC vs. Developing Oil Importers (2024 -2027)

Section IV: Leading Sect ors & Corporate Landscape

An analysis of the MENA region's economic future requires a granular look at the key sectors that will drive growth, attract

investment, and generate employment. The followi ng sections profile five of the most dynamic and strategi cally important sectors,

identifying their core market dynamics and the leading corporate players shaping their development.

Energy (Traditional & Renewable)

Market Dynamics: The energy sector remains the foundational pillar of the MENA economy, with the r egion possessing

approximately two -thirds of the world's known crude oil reserves. The dominant market dynamic is a dual -track strategy pursued

by the major hydrocarbon -produ cing states. On one track, they are investing heavily to maximize the efficiency a nd output of their

traditional oil and gas operations to meet short -to-medium -term global demand. On the other, they are simultaneously channeling

unprecedented levels of cap ital into renewable energy, positioning themselves to become future leaders in sol ar, wind, and green

hydrogen. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Morocco are at the forefront of this transition, launching giga watt -

scale solar and wind pro jects, often with the support of international financing and technology partners. This strategic pivot is

driven by the need for economic diversification, energy security, and a response to global climate imperatives.

This list reflects the dominance of National Oil Companie s alongside the strategic rise of major renewable energy developers

and utility providers.

Financial Services & Fintech

Market Dynamics: The financial services sector, particularly in the GCC, is a bastion of stability and a key enabler of economic

diversification. The banking industry is characterized by strong capitalization, healthy asset quality, and consistent profit ability,

making it a major and reliable component of regional stock exchanges. While traditional banking remains dominant, the most

dynamic area of growth is financial technology (fintech). Thriving fintech ecosystems have emerged in hubs like Dubai, Abu Dh abi,

Riyadh, and Cairo, fueled by a young, digitally -savvy population and supportive regulatory sandboxes. Digital payments, e -wallets,

Buy-Now -Pay-Later (BNPL) services, and neobanks are attracting significant venture capital investment and are rapidly

trans forming the co nsumer and SME finance landscape.

The list is dominated by the region's largest banking groups, with the inclusion of high -growth fintech unicorns and majo r

investment c onglomerates.

Technology & Digital Transformation

Market Dynamics: While still maturing, the techno logy sector is one of the fastest -growing and most strategically critical industries

in the MENA region. Its development is a central pillar of all national diversification strategies, driven by substantial gov ernment

inves tment in digital infrastructure, cloud adoption, and the cultivation of a vibrant startup ecosystem. Key technology hubs are

rapidly expanding in Dubai, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and Cairo, attracting both local and international talent. The presence and

continuo us expansion of global tech giant s like Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and SAP have been instrumental

in building local capabilities and accelerating digital transformation across all other industries. Artificial Intelligence i s a paramount

focus, with a PwC report estimati ng that AI adoption could contribute an additional 8.3 percentage points to regional GDP growth

by 2035, underscoring its transformative potential.

This lis t includes the dominant regional telecom operators that are transitioning into tech companies, a leading AI champion, and

the major international players that provide the foundational technology for the region's digital economy.

Real Estate & Construction

Market Dynamics:

The real estate and construction sector is a primary vehicle for the region's economic diversification, most visibly manifest ed in

the proliferation of "giga -projects." These large -scale, stat e-backed developments, particularly in Saudi Arabia (e.g., NEOM, Red

Sea Global, Diriyah Gate) and the UAE's continuous urban and infrastructure expansion, are designed to create new economic

ecosystems for tourism, commerce, and residential living. The se ctor's health is intrinsically linked to government expenditure,

hydrocarbon revenues that fund these projects, and overall investor confidence. While residential markets in hubs like Dubai have

shown remarkable resilience and growth, the sector's long -term trajectory depends on the successful execution of these

ambitious national visions and their ability to attract sustained foreign investment and population growth.

Tourism & Hospitality

Tourism and hospitality have been elevated to a cornerstone of economic diversification policy for ne arly every country in the

MENA region. Governments are channeling massive investments into airpor t expansions, new hotels and resorts, cultural heritage

sites, and world -class entertainment attractions to capture a larger share of the global travel market. The sector demonstrated a

strong post -pandemic recovery and possesses immense growth potential, driven by the opening of new destinations, particularly

in Saudi Arabia, which aims to attract 150 million tourists annually by 2030. While the industry remain s highly sensitive to

perceptions of geopolitical stability, major global events like the 2022 FI FA World Cup in Qatar have proven to be powerful

catalysts, enhancing infrastructure and raising the region's global profile as a premier destination.

developers creating entirely new tourist destinations.

Section V: Geographic Deep Dive: Egypt & The GCC

The GCC Engine Room: Saudi Arabia & The UAE

The Gulf Cooperation Council countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, function as the eco nomic engine of the MENA

region. Their outlook is considera bly more robust than that of their neighbors, driven by a combination of hydrocarbon wealth

and aggressive diversification strategies. After a period of muted growth in 2023 -2024 due to oil producti on cuts, the GCC bloc is

forecast to see its GDP growth ac celerate significantly, reaching between 3.2% and 4.4% in 2025 and strengthening further to a

range of 4.5% to 4.8% in 2026 -2027. This rebound is predicated on the dual tailwinds of increased oil o utput and the sustained,

robust expansion of the non -oil ec onomy, which is projected to grow at a steady pace of around 4%.

The diversification dynamics in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while sharing the common goal of reducing hydrocarbon dependency,

have distinct focuses. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is anchored in th e development of transformative giga -projects (like NEOM), the

creation of a globally competitive tourism and entertainment sector, and the expansion of its industrial and mining base. The U AE,

building on its established success, continues to reinforce it s position as a global hub for trade, logistics, finance, and tec hnology,

attracting foreign investment and talent to business -friendly free zones. A critical aspect of this strategy is the recognition that oil

revenues, for the foreseeable future, remain the essential lubricant for non -oil growth. This creates a strate gic imperative to

manage the hydrocarbon sector for maximum value to fund the transition.

Egypt: Navigating Challenges, Unlocking Potential

Egypt's e conomic journey is one of immense potential constrained by significant challenges. The country has grappled with severe

macroeconomic pressures, including extreme inflation that has ranged fr om 17% to over 28% in 2024 -2025, a heavy external debt

burden tha t quadrupled between 2015 and 2023, and persistent currency weakness. These headwinds have suppressed growth,

which is estimated to slow to 2.4% in 2024.

However, the outlook is improving. Su pported by an IMF program and, crucially, massive strategic inves tments from GCC partners,

particularly a landmark deal with the UAE, Egypt's economy is projected to recover. Growth is forecast to accelerate to a ran ge of

3.5% to 4.2% in 2025 -2026. The cou ntry's economic narrative is a balance of these headwinds against powerful tailwinds. These

include its strategic location benefiting from Suez Canal revenues, its achievement of self -sufficiency in natural gas and its

emergence as an exporter, and a resil ient tourism sector. The influx of capital from the UAE is a criti cal stabilizing factor, providing

much -needed foreign currency and catalyzing investment in key sectors like real estate and infrastructure.

The strategic nature of GCC investments in Egypt and other non -oil economies cannot be overstated. These capital fl ows are not

merely opportunistic; they represent a form of strategic hedging. By investing to shore up the economies of key regional part ners,

the GCC states are effectively creating a buffe r zone of economic stability. An economic collapse in a country a s pivotal as Egypt

would generate severe negative spillovers —from security threats to refugee crises —that could directly endanger the GCC's own

multi -trillion -dollar domestic transformation p rojects. Therefore, these investments can be seen as a core compo nent of the GCC's

own long -term risk management strategy, making GCC capital a uniquely strategic and potentially more reliable source of funding

for the region compared to purely commercial international capital.

Section VI: Strategic Recommendatio ns for Investors &

Business Leaders

The MENA r egion presents a complex but opportunity -rich environment. Success requires a strategy that is attuned to the region's

unique dynamics, its divergent growth paths, and its specific risk profile. The following r ecommendations are designed to guide

strategic decision -making for businesses and investors looking to capitalize on the region's transformation through 2030.

Identifying High -Potential Investment Arenas

To maximize returns, capital should be directed towa rds sectors that are not only growing but are also central to the region's long -

term strategic goals.

• Focus on "Enabler" Sectors: Prioritize investments in sectors that are critical enablers for the ambitious national visions.

These include logistics and s upply chain management, which are essential fo r the new trade and industrial hubs being

built; digital infrastructure, such as data centers, cybersecurity, and fintech platforms that form the backbone of a

modern economy; and renewable energy technology an d services, which are fundamental to the regio n's green

transition. These sectors often benefit from long -term government contracts and are less susceptible to short -term

consumer sentiment.

• Capitalize on the "Experience Economy": The massive investment in tourism, entertainment, and hospitality,

parti cularly in Saudi Arabia, is creating an entirely new market from a relatively low base. Opportunities abound in hotel

development and management, entertainment content and operations, and travel technology. Th is sector offers high

growth potential, especi ally for businesses that can deliver world -class, culturally authentic experiences.

• Invest in "Resilience" Sectors: Target investments in industries that address the region's core structural vulnerabilities.

This includes water technology (desalination, wa ter management, and conservation), agricultural technology (agritech)

to enhance food security, and modern healthcare services to cater to a growing and increasingly wealthy population.

These sectors are driven by fundamental needs and are likely to receiv e sustained government and private sector

support.

Mitigating Regional Risks

Navigating the region's inherent volatility is paramount. A proactive approach to risk management is essential.

• Adopt a "GCC -Plus" St rategy: For businesses entering the region, us ing the stable, well -regulated, and business -friendly

hubs of the UAE (Dubai, Abu Dhabi) or Saudi Arabia as a regional headquarters and operational launchpad is a proven

strategy. From this stable base, operati ons can be extended into more volatile but pot entially high -growth markets like

Egypt or Iraq, allowing for better risk management.

• Stress -Test for Geopolitical Scenarios: Business models and financial plans must be rigorously stress -tested against

potenti al geopolitical shocks. This includes developi ng contingency plans for supply chain disruptions (as seen in the

Red Sea), sudden downturns in tourism due to security concerns, and the impact of significant currency volatility in non -

pegged economies like E gypt.

• Navigate the Local Partner Landscape: In many sectors and jurisdictions, a strong, reputable local partner is not merely

advisable but essential for navigating complex regulatory landscapes, understanding local business culture, and

accessing key opp ortunities. Thorough due diligence on potentia l partners is one of the most critical steps for successful

market entry.

Capitalizing on Structural Reforms

The region's economic transformation is being driven from the top down. Aligning business strategy wi th these national agendas

is key to unlocking the most significant opportunities.

• Align with National Visions: Actively seek opportunities that are in direct alignment with the stated goals of national

development plans, such as Saudi Vision 2030, the UAE's economic strategies, or Qatar's National Vis ion 2030. This

alignment increases the likelihood of receiving g overnment support, benefiting from favorable regulatory treatment,

and gaining access to lucrative public -private partnership (PPP) projects.

• Monitor Privatization and SOE Reform: The gradual reform, corporatization, and potential privatization of large st ate-

owned enterprises (SOEs) will unlock substantial opportunities for private investment, particularly in sectors like utilities ,

logistics, and industrials. Maintaining close market intellig ence on these developments will allow for early -mover

advantages .

• Invest in Local Talent Development: With high youth unemployment and strong government mandates for workforce

"nationalization" (e.g., Saudization, Emiratization ), companies that proactively invest in hiring, training, and developing

local talent will ga in a significant competitive and regulatory advantage. This approach builds goodwill, ensures

compliance, and creates a more sustainable and integrated local operation.
